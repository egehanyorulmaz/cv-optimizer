  "years_overlap": {
    "score": float,
    "reasoning": "string explanation"
  },
  "role_similarity": {
    "score": float,
    "reasoning": "string explanation"
  },
  "domain_relevance": {

**Reasoning Guidelines (apply internally, output only JSON):**
- `role_similarity`: Compare action verbs, responsibilities, project scopes in resume descriptions against the job description duties.
- `domain_relevance`: Look for industry keywords, company descriptions (if inferrable), and project contexts.
- `tech_stack_overlap`: Identify specific tools, languages, platforms mentioned in resume descriptions and compare against the job's tech stack list.
- `leadership_alignment`: Search for keywords like 'led', 'managed', 'supervised', 'mentored', 'coordinated team', etc., and assess relevance to the target role's seniority/scope.
- `company_alignment`: Compare the candidate's past companies' size and industry with the target company's size and industry.
